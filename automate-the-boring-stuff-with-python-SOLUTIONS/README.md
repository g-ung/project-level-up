Solutions to some of the projects from the book <a href="https://automatetheboringstuff.com/">Automate the Boring Stuff with Python</a>, by Al Sweigart.  I will eventually complete all of the exercises/projects as I progress through the book and add them here, so watch this pace.

I may, from time to time, refactor some of the code in this repository as I gain more knowledge and experiece with Python.
